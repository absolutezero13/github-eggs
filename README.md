# Interview project

## Goal

Create a small project using the Github API with the following requirements:

- Search by name using Github API and list repositories.
- Search username repositories and list them.
- Show the selected repository detail
- Show the selected user detail
- Bookmark repositories.
- Page to list bookmarked repositories
- Search bookmarked repositories

## Solution

- The whole project should be done with React Hooks
- Git should be actively used when developing the project
- The project should be submitted with the public repository link which is used.
- Using Typescript
- Using ES6 syntax (arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, etc)
- Tests with @testing-library/react

## Bonus

- Use some state managers (Using useContext or redux as a state manager is a plus)
- Using Linters

## Recommended libraries

- @material-ui
- react-router-dom

## Comments

- You can use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.
- You should use [Github Rest API Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference) to fetch data.
